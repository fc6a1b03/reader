# 📚 Reader: Local Deployment Edition

This is an adapted version of [Jina AI's Reader](https://github.com/jina-ai/reader) for local deployment using Docker. 

## 🎯 What it does
It converts any URL to an LLM-friendly input with `http://127.0.0.1:3000/https://google.com`. Get improved output for your agent and RAG systems at no cost. This tool helps you prepare web content for Large Language Models, making it easier to process and analyze online information.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🏠 Runs locally using Docker
- 🔑 No API keys required - works out of the box!
- 🖼️ Saves screenshots locally instead of uploading to Google Cloud Storage
- 📥 Provides download URLs for saved screenshots
- 🌐 Converts web content to LLM-friendly formats

## ⚠️ Limitations
- 📄 Currently does not support parsing PDFs

## 💻 Demo Environment
The live demo is running on a VPS with the following specifications:
- CPU: 1 vCore
- RAM: 0.5 GB
- Web Server: nginx

This demonstrates that the Reader can run effectively even on minimal hardware resources.
## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### Option 1: Using the pre-built image
1. Pull the latest image:
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/intergalacticalvariable/reader:latest
   ```
2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v /path/to/local-storage:/app/local-storage --name reader-container ghcr.io/intergalacticalvariable/reader:latest
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/local-storage` with the directory where you want to store screenshots.
   This command does the following:
   - Maps port 3000 of the container to port 3000 on your host
   - Mounts a volume for local storage
   - Names the container `reader-container`
3. To stop the container:
   ```bash
   docker stop reader-container
   ```
4. To start the container again:
   ```bash
   docker start reader-container
   ```

### Option 2: Building the image locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/intergalacticalvariable/reader.git
   cd reader
   ```
2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t reader .
   ```
3. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /path/to/local-storage:/app/local-storage reader
   ```

## 🖥️ Usage
Once the Docker container is running, you can use curl to make requests. Here are examples for different response types:

1. 📝 Markdown (bypasses readability processing):
   ```bash
   curl -H "X-Respond-With: markdown" 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/https://google.com'
   ```

2. 🌐 HTML (returns documentElement.outerHTML):
   ```bash
   curl -H "X-Respond-With: html" 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/https://google.com'
   ```

3. 📄 Text (returns document.body.innerText):
   ```bash
   curl -H "X-Respond-With: text" 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/https://google.com'
   ```

4. 📸 Screen-Size Screenshot (returns the URL of the webpage's screenshot):
   ```bash
   curl -H "X-Respond-With: screenshot" 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/https://google.com'
   ```

5.  📸 Full-Page Screenshot (returns the URL of the webpage's screenshot):
